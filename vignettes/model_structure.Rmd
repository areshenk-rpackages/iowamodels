**iowamodels** is designed to implement a broad class of reinforcement learning models
of the Iowa gambling task, which take the following general form:

In the task, the subject is presented with a set of $K$ decks, each of which 
produces a reward or loss with some unknown frequency. Typically, the subject is 
instructed only to maximize their total earnings by the end of the task, which they
must do by learning which of the decks is the most profitable over the long term.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
# All defaults
knitr::include_graphics('figures/fig_deckillustration.png')
```

Upon selecting a deck, the subject sees an outcome $x$, which they assign some
utility $u(x)$. Note that, in many implementations of the task, the subject
experiences both a gain $g$ and a loss $l$, and the utility function assumes that
the utility of the outcome is some weighted combination of these two.

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.align = 'center'}
# All defaults
knitr::include_graphics('figures/fig_deckpayout.png')
```

The assumption is that the subject maintains a valuation $V = (v_1,v_2,v_3,v_4)$
for each deck, corresponding to its expected utility. Upon selecting a deck $d$, 
the subject observes an outcome with utility $u$ and updates the corresponding
deck valuation through some updating function. The probability of selecting deck
$d$ on the next trial is computed with a softmax function 

$$
P(d) = \frac{e^{\theta V_d}}{\sum_{i=1}^4 e^{\theta V_i}}
$$

where $\theta$ is a temperature parameter controlling the stochasticity of the
decision rule. The temperature schedule (i.e. how it evolves over the course of 
the task) is controlled by a temperature function $\theta(t)$, where $t$ is the
current trial.

### Specifying a model

Models implemented by **iowamodels** require specifying the utility, updating, and 
temperature functions. The package implements several common versions of each,
based on models which have been commonly reported in the literature. Each
function is identified by a keyword, and utility/updating/temperature functions
can be mixed and matched. Detailed information about available options is given
in the respective articles.
